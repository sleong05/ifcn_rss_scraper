(Courtesy: Robert Scherle) By: Barbara Allen February 23, 2026 An unabridged version of this article was originally published in the Student Press Report , a national news desk covering student media and journalism education in higher ed. Andrew Frazier expected to spend his senior year as the sports editor of The Vista, the student newspaper at the University of Central Oklahoma. Instead, he became editor-in-chief of a new student-run publication, The Independent View , after his university said printing The Vista wasn\u2019t worth the $12,000 annual cost. (UCO\u2019s operating budget in 2024-25 was about $177 million.) When donors offered to cover the expense and the university still said no, free press advocates shouted censorship. They said the UCO students were being punished for factual reporting that didn\u2019t frame the university in a positive light. \u201c(This) raised serious press freedom questions for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a clear digital transition plan, the move felt less like modernization and more like retaliation, which is why we chose to build something independent.\u201d The cover of a recent Independent View issue. Across the country, student newsrooms are facing a similar squeeze: shrinking budgets and increasing pressure from the universities that fund them. Student press advocates say those forces \u2014 financial strain and institutional control \u2014 are reshaping campus journalism and, in some cases, threatening to destroy independent student media. Silence is the point The Student Press Law Center, a 51-year-old nonprofit that defends and advances student journalists\u2019 free press rights, said it\u2019s seen an alarming uptick in calls over the past few years. (The Student Press Law Center is a funder of the Student Press Report.) \u201cCensorship has always been our No. 1 reason why people reach out to our legal hotline,\u201d said Gary Green, executive director of SPLC. Calls rose 42% from the 2022-23 school year to 2024-25, he said. One of several instigators of that surge was the March 2025 detention of R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, an international student at Tufts University, after she wrote a pro-Palestinian op-ed in The Tufts Daily. That and other immigration enforcement actions in spring 2025 sparked panic \u2014 and self-censorship \u2014 among sources and staff members. In April 2025, SPLC issued a first-of-its-kind student media alert , urging students to \u201crevisit their policies on takedown requests and anonymous sources, particularly for those whose immigration status may make them targets for their lawful speech.\u201d Student Press Law Center executive director Gary Green speaks at the SPLC 50th anniversary celebration at The New York Times in October 2024. (Photo by Ryan Murphy) Across the country, conflicts between universities and student newsrooms have followed familiar patterns: Students started their own independent publication at the University of Texas at Dallas after the school removed newspaper racks, demoted their adviser and fired the editor-in-chief . Students at the University of Central Oklahoma created their own independent news publication after their print budget was killed and editors were stripped of decision-making power. The University of Alabama shuttered two magazines that officials felt might conflict with federal DEI rollbacks. Morgan State in Baltimore made an official policy requiring students, faculty and staff to run all interview and filming requests through the university\u2019s public relations office. Staffers at The Exponent newspaper at Purdue got a surprise email from the university stating that after a 50-year relationship, the university would no longer partner with distribution efforts on campus . But the biggest student media news of 2025 came from one of the most awarded, respected student newspapers in the country. In October, Jim Rodenbush was fired as\u00a0director of student media at Indiana University after he refused to enforce an administrative mandate: no news content in the printed homecoming edition. IU Media School dean David Tolchinsky wrote in Rodenbush\u2019s termination letter, \u201cYour lack of leadership and ability to work in alignment with the university\u2019s direction for the Student Media Plan is unacceptable.\u201d Rodenbush said he believed enforcing the directive would amount to censorship and refused to do so. \u201cBecause it was the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a responsibility to maintain standards and ethics, particularly in student journalism, because this is the future of the profession.\u201d Indiana Daily Student co-editors in chief Mia Hilkowitz and Andrew Miller address their newsroom staff after the university fired student media director Jim Rodenbush and canceled the print production of the IDS. (Courtesy: Indiana Daily Student) University officials disputed that characterization. Chancellor David Reingold said the decision was unrelated to editorial content and stemmed from personnel and budget considerations. Rodenbush has filed suit alleging violations of due process and free speech. Advisers say the case illustrates how fragile student newsrooms can be when universities control the funding. \u201cA lot of student media are in the red, and really at an existential crisis,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey\u2019re relying more and more on university subsidies, and universities, in many cases, are pulling their subsidies.\u201d Universities may eliminate funding entirely or reduce it gradually over time, he said. If cuts are tied to coverage, that raises constitutional concerns, but proving it can be difficult. Running on empty \u201cGutted,\u201d \u201ceviscerated\u201d and \u201cabsent\u201d are some of the words student media leaders use to describe their operating budgets since the 2008 recession. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost entire categories of advertisers, we receive less revenue from our digital products than our print newspapers could bring in, and it\u2019s much harder to compete with Google and social media platforms for new dollars,\u201d said Chrissy Murray, CEO at Duke Student Publishing Company/The Chronicle. Student journalists working inside the offices of The Duke Chronicle. (Courtesy: Chrissy Murray) Some outlets have tried to replace lost revenue with fundraising, memberships and side projects such as creative services. But many remain financially fragile. A 2024 study by the University of Florida\u2019s Brechner Center for the Advancement of the First Amendment found that more than half of student news outlets receive direct funding from their universities, and nearly 60% are advised by university employees. That dependence can create tension. \u201cFinancial ties to the institution can be problematic for student journalists for several reasons,\u201d the study noted. \u201cStudents who challenge the wrong person in administration are vulnerable to lose funding for their student press if there aren\u2019t several safety guards in place.\u201d Lead author Jessica Sparks, now a professor at Auburn, said the concerns she wrote about two years ago seem even more pressing now. \u201cOne of the biggest things that clicked for me\u2026 was the idea that there\u2019s no such thing as a truly independent institution in this realm,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, what we\u2019re looking at is, how vulnerable are you as a publication to the pressure or censorship? And what can you do to mitigate that vulnerability?\u201d Other data underscores how sharply the business model has eroded. An analysis of nonprofit student newsrooms found advertising revenue \u2014 once the dominant income source \u2014 fell from 91% of revenue in 2006\u201307 to 52% in 2022\u201323. Student media now faces structural disadvantages, said Bob Buday, one of the researchers:\u00a0high student turnover, university administrators cutting their funding, and a lack of best-practice research that keeps U.S. companies humming along. \u201cCollege media has not had the same thing,\u201d he said. What successful student media often does have, however, is strong professional leadership, he said. How to stay alive At The Duke Chronicle, a housing site and robust fundraising have helped the paper stay afloat. \u201c(Student media) has lost a ton of revenue in the last 15 years because of print,\u201d Murray said. \u201cSo few of us have refilled those buckets with other things, or we did it at a lower level. Now we\u2019re at a point where we\u2019re not sure if those buckets are going to hold in the economic downturn and what comes next. Then layer onto that the reader habits of undergraduates. \u2026 Finding our audiences is going to be really complicated. And I don\u2019t know how many (college) news organizations are up for that challenge.\u201d Murray said newsletter and fundraising efforts have become increasingly important. Duke\u2019s fundraising now makes up 30-35% of its student media\u2019s annual operating budget. Some outlets are also rethinking how they operate. At the University of Illinois, Illini Media reorganized its systems and business model, cutting outdated processes and focusing on sustainable products and partnerships. \u201cWhen your newspaper or news outlet is 150-some years old, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that you do because you\u2019ve always done it,\u201d said Illini CEO Jake Williams. \u201cAnd we really spent the last two years breaking as much of that down as possible and making sure that everyone had a clean path to just do what they were here to do.\u201d Partnerships have been key for some organizations. Gerald Johnson said Texas Student Media, once losing about $250,000 a year, has been profitable for more than a decade after investing in events, partnerships and new ventures. \u201cIf you\u2019re not making money and you\u2019re a strain on your campus, there certainly is the opportunity for more conversations about, \u2018Why are you still here? Maybe you should go away,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think our stability has created some protection from those conversations.\u201d Others emphasize diversifying revenue wherever possible. \u201cStudent fees can vanish in a second, grants can be fickle, donors don\u2019t always come through,\u201d said said Piper Jackson-Sevy, co-founder of Flytedesk, a campus advertising network. \u201cThe long-term financial health for student media means a healthy balance of several income sources.\u201d (Flytedesk is a funder of the Student Press Report.) Student journalists Nina Kudlacz, Emma DeShon and Izzy Lewis on the field at Memorial Stadium at the University of Nebraska before a Huskers football game in 2025. (Courtesy: The Daily Nebraskan) At the Daily Nebraskan, advertising partnerships with other campus departments have become a major source of revenue, said general manager Allen Vaughan. \u201cThe newsroom is the essence of everything that we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to figure out how to fund it.\u201d Why student newsrooms matter College newsrooms are a unique American institution, places for students to experiment, explore careers, find friends and mentors, and test their leadership skills. \u201cFrom day one, you\u2019re bonding with people from literally all walks of life, in a really cool space doing great work,\u201d said Murray of Duke. \u201cSo it\u2019s this mission-driven kind of environment, but it\u2019s also just fun. I\u2019m showing my bias here, but I don\u2019t think that there are leadership positions that have quite this much power in any other place on campus.\u201d For some advisers, the fight to protect student media is personal. Community college \u2014 particularly the student media experience \u2014\u00a0was transformative for Sarah Bennett, a former student journalist who is now a professor of journalism and media studies at Santa Ana College in Southern California. \u201cI didn\u2019t have stable housing, I didn\u2019t have parents really around. Guidance was not there in my upbringing, in my life, and Bud (Little, former Santa Ana adviser) was really the first adult and male figure in my life that was positive and healthy,\u201d said Bennett, who has advised student media for the last 10 years. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am if it wasn\u2019t for him, and I see so much of myself in my students.\u201d El Don adviser Sarah Bennett (center) works with students at Santa Ana College. (Courtesy: El Don) Steven Chappell, a newspaper adviser at Northwest Missouri State with more than 30 years of experience, said he wants his students to understand their role in fighting back when democracy is under attack. \u201cThe foundation of democracy is a strong media. And a strong media starts with strong student journalists who are excited about going into the field of media,\u201d he said. Some students are feeling empowered to fight back. Lindsie Rank, director of campus rights advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said that seeing the headlines about protesters, journalists and others standing up for their rights can be inspiring for students. \u201cBut, honestly, I\u2019m afraid more students are scared into silence rather than empowered by the current climate,\u201d she said. Student journalists often worry about retaliation even when advocates are ready to help. A rounding error worth fighting for Universities subsidize athletic programs, transportation, housing, the arts and lecture series, the SPLC\u2019s Green said. Student media should not be an exception. \u201cThe amount of university funds supporting student media in many cases accounts for no more than a rounding error in the overall budget,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s a critical institution. \u201cStudent media plays an integral role in our media ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pipeline for the future of journalism. People need to have a better understanding of the challenges of student media, and the more we get that news and information out to a broader audience, the more support we can cultivate for the great work the student journalists, their advisers and their faculty do.\u201d The Daily Illini editorial board at a recruitment event in 2026. (Photo by Sarah Slattery) Williams, at The Daily Illini, said that while censorship and money are two huge issues facing student media, he thinks student media practitioners \u2014\u00a0both students and professionals \u2014 need to think bigger and holistically about the role they play in society. \u201cYes, let\u2019s focus on the tactical.\u00a0How do we stay in business? That\u2019s very important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also we need to be able to come together and say, \u2018This is what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re here for this purpose,\u2019 because the threats are only getting bigger.\u201d Correction, Monday, Feb 23 (4 p.m. Eastern): An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of a former University of Texas student media director.

    "title": "Did President Trump call into C-SPAN under a fake name?",
    "content": "Commentary Newsletters President Donald Trump speaks at the National Governors Association dinner at the White House on Saturday. (AP Photo/Allison Robbert) By: Tom Jones February 23, 2026 This is The Poynter Report, your daily guide to the news about news. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every weekday. There was a bizarre moment on C-SPAN on Friday when the network, during the time when viewers can call in and voice their opinions, took a call from a Republican named \u201cJohn Barron.\u201d The man was calling in to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that President Donald Trump violated federal law by imposing sweeping tariffs across the world. The voice sounded awfully familiar. \u201cJohn Barron\u201d was either Trump himself or someone doing a spot-on Trump imitation, right down to the sophomoric insults that the president is so fond of. The call lasted 32 seconds before the caller was cut off. During that half-minute, Barron called House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries a \u201cdope\u201d and said that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u201ccan\u2019t cook a cheeseburger.\u201d Not only did the voice sound like Trump, but the name \u201cJohn Barron\u201d was one Trump commonly used years ago to feed information to reporters. Here\u2019s the clip. The speculation that it was Trump was rampant enough that C-SPAN put out a statement on Sunday that said: \u201cBecause so many of you are talking about Friday\u2019s C-SPAN caller who identified himself as \u2018John Barron,\u2019 we want to put this to rest: it was not the president. The call came from a central Virginia phone number and came while the president was in a widely covered, in-person White-House meeting with the governors. Tune into C-SPAN for the actual president at the State of the Union Address on Tuesday night.\u201d Was it the president? No, probably not. It might have been a great imitator. It might have even been AI-generated. But part of the issue is that, besides sounding like Trump, it\u2019s not hard to believe that Trump would actually do something like that. State of the Union Trump will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. In a column, USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page asks, \u201cTrump v. Trump. Which president shows up at the State of the Union?\u201d Page writes, \u201cWill Trump use the opportunity to deliver a forward-looking agenda designed to boost fellow Republicans, some unnerved by Democratic victories in a series of special elections over the past year? Or one that exalts the achievements he claims to have already scored?\u201d Then again, we could see an angry Trump following his Supreme Court loss, among other negative news. Politico\u2019s Megan Messerly and Daniel Desrochers wrote , \u201cEconomic growth is flagging . U.S. military assets are massing in the waters around Iran in anticipation of a potential strike that many in the president\u2019s base find odious. A major government agency is shut down over an immigration standoff with Democrats sparked after federal agents killed two U.S. citizens. \u2018Make America Healthy Again\u2019 activists are furious over Trump\u2019s order boosting domestic production of the herbicide glyphosate. The scandal surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, continues to swirl.\u201d The latest Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released over the weekend shows Trump\u2019s approval rating at 39% and his disapproval rate at 60%, including 47% who strongly disapprove of the job he is doing. The Post notes that the \u201clast time Trump\u2019s disapproval touched 60 percent was shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\u201d Warner Bros. Discovery drama The drama about who is going to end up purchasing Warner Bros. Discovery could come to a head this week. Or at least get a bit clearer. For the past several weeks, it appeared that Netflix had the upper hand in acquiring WBD, which seemed committed to accepting the streaming service\u2019s offer. But Paramount Skydance, run by the Ellison family, refused to give up even after WBD accepted the offer from Netflix. Paramount has mounted a hostile takeover bid, and last week, was given another chance to make its best and final offer \u2014 with the window for that expiring today. Any deal would require approval from the Trump administration\u2019s regulators, and much has been made about the cozy relationship Trump has with Paramount CEO David Ellison and his father, Larry. Then, on Friday, Variety\u2019s Todd Spangler wrote , \u201cParamount Skydance said its potential deal to snap up Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety has cleared antitrust review at the U.S. Justice Department \u2014 despite the fact that David Ellison\u2019s Paramount has repeatedly failed to secure an agreement to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD for now remains committed to its deal with Netflix.\u201d Meanwhile, Netflix continues to push back against Paramount, with Netflix chief legal officer David Hyman saying in a statement, \u201cThe facts are that routine HRS (antitrust) milestones do not signal DOJ approval nor that any decision has been made. They have not secured approvals needed to close and they are a long way from doing so.\u201d It should be noted that Paramount has said it doesn\u2019t have an agreement in place to buy WBD. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it wrote, \u201cThe completion of the Transaction remains subject to certain other conditions, including entry into a definitive merger agreement with WBD, shareholder approval and regulatory clearance in other relevant jurisdictions.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s first comments For the first time, Conan O\u2019Brien spoke publicly about the deaths of director Rob Reiner and Reiner\u2019s wife, Michele. The Reiners attended a holiday party at O\u2019Brien\u2019s Brentwood, California, home on Dec. 13. The day after the party, the Reiners were found murdered in their home. Their 32-year-old son, Nick, who was also at that party, has been charged with murdering his parents. There have been reports that Nick acted strangely at the party and he had a loud exchange with his parents. O\u2019Brien told \u201cThe New Yorker Radio Hour\u201d podcast and host David Remnick, \u201cTo have that experience of saying good night to somebody and having them leave and then find out the next day that they\u2019re gone \u2026 I think I was in shock for quite a while afterward. I mean, there\u2019s no other word for it. It\u2019s just very \u2014 it\u2019s so awful. It\u2019s just so awful.\u201d O\u2019Brien not only praised Rob Reiner\u2019s immense talent, but also talked about how Rob and Michele were such \u201clovely people.\u201d O\u2019Brien added, \u201cI think about how Rob felt about things that are happening in the country, how involved he was, how much he put himself out there \u2014 and to have that voice go quiet in an instant is still hard for me to comprehend.\u201d NBC\u2019s Olympic hockey coverage scores big The Milan Cortina Winter Olympic Games ended with a bang on Sunday as the United States defeated Canada, 2-1 in overtime, to win the much-anticipated gold medal game in men\u2019s hockey. (Earlier in the Games, the U.S. women\u2019s hockey team defeated Canada by the exact 2-1 overtime score.) It was the U.S. men\u2019s first hockey gold medal since the \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d team in 1980. The winning goal was scored by center Jack Hughes, who had at least three of his teeth knocked out by a high stick earlier in the game. Hockey players, right? The thrilling hockey game, followed by the closing ceremony, capped a marvelous two-and-a-half weeks for NBC Sports, which is collecting mostly high praise for its coverage. Hockey announcer Kenny Albert has further established himself as the best voice in hockey, firmly replacing the great Mike Emrick, who retired in 2020. Albert\u2019s calls on both the U.S. women\u2019s and men\u2019s overtime winners were universally praised. Not only did Albert make great calls, he (and Sunday\u2019s broadcast partners Eddie Olczyk and Brian Boucher) also knew when to be quiet, letting the player and crowd reactions tell the story for more than a minute without saying a word. Podcaster Bill Simmons was just one of many who took to social media to compliment NBC\u2019s hockey coverage, tweeting , \u201cThought NBC did an elite job with the hockey broadcasts.\u201d NBC Olympic host Mike Tirico then gave a stirring tribute in his final commentary following the game. Among Tirico\u2019s comments: \u201cSo, for all the young people out there, not just the hockey, but all the Olympics you\u2019ve watched, those dreams are formed now. Go chase them and go get them, because our country loves sports, and it brings us together unlike anything else.\u201d Meanwhile, columnist Barry Svrluga offered up his final dispatch for The Washington Post: \u201cJoy and pain for the U.S. and Canada, and a hockey game that had all the feels.\u201d Svrluga, one of the finest sports columnists in the country, was among the recent layoffs at the Post. Despite being laid off, he continued to cover the Olympics and finished with one superb column. Golden messages Yes, social media has its flaws, but one of the great things about it is that you get to hear and read the thoughts of well-known people and celebrities in real time. For example, it was cool to see the reaction of Jim Craig, one of the stars of the 1980 U.S. \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d team. The goalie of that team tweeted , \u201cForty-six years ago, we had our shot. They called it a miracle. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 it was trust, preparation, and belief. Today, the men and women of @usahockey proved it again. Proud of what USA Hockey was \u2013 and what it continues to be.\u201d And Mike Eruzione, the captain of the \u201980 team who scored the game-winning goal in the \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d victory against the then-USSR, tweeted , \u201cWhat a great Olympic games are men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey teams congratulations to the men and our women on achieving the ultimate dream and winning a gold medal. How sweet and how nice it was to be here and to watch both your teams accomplish that.\u201d Best moment of the day United States\u2019 hockey player Zach Werenski (8) poses with Noa, the daughter of late player Johnny Gaudreau, after a men\u2019s ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States on Sunday. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Perhaps the most poignant and memorable moment of the Olympics was what happened after the U.S. men defeated Canada in the gold-medal hockey game. As the American players gathered on the ice for a team photo, they held up the hockey jersey with the name \u201cGaudreau\u201d on it \u2014 for Johnny Gaudreau, an American hockey player killed in 2024 when he and his brother were hit by a car while bicycling. Gaudreau almost certainly would have been a member of the 2026 American Olympic team. So on Sunday, as the team was getting ready for their photo, American hockey star Matthew Tkachuk held a jersey with Gaudreau\u2019s name, while two other players went into the stands to collect Gaudreau\u2019s small children to be in the team photo. Here\u2019s the touching clip. Sports Illustrated\u2019s Pat Forde wrote about Gaudreau in \u201cTeam USA Honored Johnny Gaudreau\u2019s Memory by Making Him an Olympic Champion.\u201d Dissecting what happened at the Post Be sure to check out the latest episode of \u201cThe Poynter Report Podcast.\u201d My guest is media reporter Paul Farhi. We did a deep dive into The Washington Post, from the time Jeff Bezos bought the paper to the recent massive layoffs to what the future might look like.

    "content": "Business & Work Fact-Checking Toronto street scene. (Louis Jacobson/Poynter) By: Louis Jacobson February 23, 2026 TORONTO \u2014 Daniel Dale is Canada\u2019s most famous fact-checking journalist. He\u2019s also one of Canada\u2019s only fact-checking journalists. And therein lies a tale of politics, media, and some key differences between the United States and Canada. Dale was born in Toronto, graduated with a business degree from York University, and made his way into journalism. He was hired by the Toronto Star in 2008, where, among other things, he would cover the late, troubled, larger-than-life Toronto mayor, Rob Ford. Eventually Dale was dispatched to be the Star\u2019s correspondent in Washington, D.C. After Donald Trump began his first presidential run in 2015, Dale found himself intrigued by Trump\u2019s numerous, less-than-accurate claims in his public appearances. In addition to his regular articles as a foreign correspondent, Dale began tweeting lists of false things Trump had said during his campaign rallies. Dale\u2019s posts quickly caught on, especially among Americans during the 2016 election. CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale in Toronto. (Louis Jacobson/Poynter) Dale\u2019s editor at the Star, Ed Tubb, worked with him to regularize his Trump fact-checking on the newspaper\u2019s website and weave it into his overall coverage. Dale and Tubb focused on Trump\u2019s clearest, most obvious falsehoods as a way of highlighting how different he was as a politician, Tubb recalled. The pair created a running database of Trump\u2019s questionable claims that eventually numbered in the thousands. \u201cIt was never his sole day job, but it did become more of one for him,\u201d Tubb said. In metrics like pageviews and time spent on the site, Dale\u2019s work \u201cwas always at the top of the charts,\u201d Tubb said. And when it came to selling the project to the Star\u2019s higher-ups, Tubb said, \u201cI never had any trouble.\u201d Then, in 2019, CNN came calling, and like countless Canadian professionals before him , Dale headed to the vastly larger U.S. market. For the rest of Trump\u2019s first term, and now in Trump\u2019s second term, Dale has become a familiar on-air presence, holding Trump accountable for his statements for a U.S. audience. Back in Canada, the Star has periodically revived fact-checking journalism, including during Canada\u2019s 2021 federal elections and other political coverage . But as a Canadian fact-checking journalist, Dale has been a unicorn. As I was reporting this article in Toronto and elsewhere, one observation came up repeatedly: Fact-checking in Canada is ad hoc. Here, there is no equivalent of PolitiFact, the dedicated fact-checking website where I am chief correspondent, or FactCheck.org. Nor is there a dedicated political fact-checking position at a major media outlet, like the one Glenn Kessler held at The Washington Post until recently or that Linda Qiu holds at The New York Times. One recent example from when I was in the country: On Feb. 9, Trump used a social media post to assail an almost-ready-to-open bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. The controversy attracted wide coverage in the Canadian media, but mostly as a news story or as fodder for opinion pieces. I found just one article by a Canadian-owned outlet labeled as a fact check \u2014 by CTV, a for-profit broadcaster \u2014 and it was written by a regular anchor and reporter for the network based in Windsor, not a fact-checking specialist. The French news service Agence France-Presse, well regarded in international fact-checking circles, also published a fact check . Naturally, Dale filed a fact check for CNN and its U.S. audience. Dale\u2019s rise benefited from an unusual set of circumstances. Not only did he have a special knack for fact-checking and social media, but in Trump he found a subject who made more questionable claims than anyone \u2014 certainly anyone in Canada. Some Canadian politicians \u2014 such as Ford or his brother Doug, Ontario\u2019s provincial premier \u2014 have superficial stylistic similarities with Trump, notably their rough outspokenness. But analysts here say the range and degree of falsehoods in the Ford brothers\u2019 rhetoric have hardly compared to Trump\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to think of a precedent\u201d for Trump among Canadian politicians, Tubb said. Ed Tubb, an editor at the Toronto Star, at its newsroom in Toronto. (Louis Jacobson/Poynter) So Dale\u2019s departure to a U.S. media outlet was likely preordained. \u201cBeing next to the U.S., so much of the information environment is influenced by the U.S.,\u201d Tubb said. \u201cTo have the only full-time English-language fact-checker being someone covering Trump \u2014 it feels very \u2018Canadian media.\u2019\u201d Other fact-checking efforts in Canada Canada may lack specialized fact-checking journalists, but it does have a lively sector adjacent to it. At McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, the Digital Society Lab is exploring a variety of emerging technologies, such as using machine learning to model the flows of misinformation on social media platforms, said Clifton van der Linden, a political scientist and academic director of the lab. This follows previous work on health misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThere are not enough supercomputers to run every post through them,\u201d said John McAndrews, the lab\u2019s managing director. \u201cSo one approach is to say we need to have data reduction earlier in the pipeline, to make the rest of the pipeline more efficient.\u201d The lab has also spearheaded a promise tracker , covering not only Canada\u2019s prime minister but also its provincial premiers. Clifton van der Linden and John McAndrews of the Digital Society Lab at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. (Louis Jacobson/Poynter) The Canadian Press, a wire service, is a member of Poynter\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network; recent fact checks include a mix of debunked social media claims and a fact check of Trump . A key node of the misinformation-tracking community in Toronto is Craig Silverman, who previously worked for BuzzFeed Canada and ProPublica and who for a while published his column \u201cRegret the Error\u201d for Poynter . Today, Silverman runs Indicator , an outfit in which he collaborates with Alexios Mantzarlis, the onetime head of Poynter\u2019s International Fact Checking Network and a veteran of Google. Indicator provides tools, workshops and training to help professionals navigate and investigate the digital information landscape Craig Silverman, co-founder of Indicator, in Toronto. (Louis Jacobson/Poynter) Toronto also serves as a welcoming home for Farhad Souzanchi, the editor of Factnameh , a fact-checking service focusing on claims from and about Iran. The site\u2019s articles are accessible by virtual private networks in Iran and widely read despite government opposition. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any red lines\u201d for covering and debunking claims, Souzanchi said in an interview here. \u201cWe have fact-checked the supreme leader, which would be absolutely off limits inside Iran.\u201d In one case, the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, had to backtrack on a claim he made after Factnameh debunked his assertion. One of the newest entries in the misinformation sphere is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Canada\u2019s public broadcaster. A year and a half ago, the CBC launched a visual investigations team that uses a combination of open-source investigation, digital forensics and traditional journalism techniques to both support CBC\u2019s regular news coverage and publish articles and projects of its own. Litsa Sourtzis and Eric Szeto of the CBC News visual investigations unit at CBC headquarters in Toronto. (Louis Jacobson/Poynter) The unit has debunked an image of accused drug kingpin Ryan Wedding shared by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum as generated by artificial intelligence; calculated that two of Canada\u2019s biggest political parties had exaggerated the size of crowds at their rallies; determined that viral videos a white man complaining about the difficulty of getting a job in Canada were made by AI; and investigated claims about fake \u201cFIFA visas\u201d to Canada for the World Cup. The team\u2019s video breaking down the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis received 8 million views. In a collaboration with the international investigative outlet Bellingcat and the Danish news outlets TjekDet and Politiken, the CBC team published an expose of a deepfake pornography site called MrDeepFakes. And in collaboration with local journalists, the team has launched a series about white nationalist fighting clubs . Why classic fact-checking is ad hoc in Canada With all this ferment for pursuing misinformation \u2014 and with Canada\u2019s educated, affluent, information-seeking population \u2014 the Canadian media\u2019s ad hoc approach to traditional political fact checking might seem like a mystery, especially when so many American news outlets have adopted the approach. But if you look closer, a few reasons may explain it: Political campaigns are shorter in Canada. Unlike in the U.S., where campaigning is constant and unending, Canadian campaigns last for a few weeks. So for a Canadian fact-checker, there would be a quick sprint, followed by a need to write about something else \u2026 for the next few years. (Observers here say Canadian politicians really do abide by the no-campaigning norm between election periods, to the relief of the public.) Canadian legacy media outlets are under strain. Having a full-time fact checker (or something close) would be an unimaginable luxury in today\u2019s media climate, observers here said. Headlines about massive layoffs at The Washington Post resurrected unhappy memories in Canada, said van der Linden of McMaster\u2019s Digital Society Lab, but \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a lot of headlines like that in Canada.\u201d Canadians are less tolerant of culture-war division. While Canada certainly has ideological divides, its political rhetoric tends to be more measured. Politics here is mostly practiced within narrower parameters, in part because the electorate includes a sizable share of persuadable swing voters. That makes politicians less likely to appeal to the extremes with questionable claims. Canadian politicians are more restrained by shame than U.S. politicians are. \u201cOne thing I see among Canadian politicians on most levels is a willingness to concede mistakes,\u201d van der Linden said. When a falsehood emerges here, it\u2019s often because of a simple mess-up, and the truth tends to be pretty boring. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many Pants on Fire claims here,\u201d Tubb said. Tubb said his paper is likely to dip back into fact-checking when necessary. But in all likelihood, he added, the pursuit of fact-checking \u201cwill continue to be ad hoc.\u201d Poynter is a nonprofit dedicated to keeping journalism strong, relevant, and grounded in sound values.

(NASA, ESA, CSA, STScl, and Webb ERO Production Team via AP) By: Maria Brice\u00f1o February 23, 2026 President Donald Trump said Thursday he will direct multiple U.S. government agencies to declassify files related to aliens and UFOs. The move came five days after former President Barack Obama sparked interest in the topic by saying aliens are real. Obama made the comments in a Feb. 14 interview with political commentator and podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen , who asked Obama a lightning round of questions, including whether aliens are real. Obama\u2019s answer in the affirmative quickly went viral on social media. Aboard\u00a0 Air Force One Feb. 19, Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked Trump: \u201cSo aliens are real?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re real or not,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can tell you (Obama) gave classified information. He\u2019s not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information.\u201d Doocy then said Trump, as president, can declassify anything he wants to. \u201cI may get him out of trouble by declassifying it,\u201d Trump responded, referring to Obama. Hours later, Trump said on Truth Social he would do just that. \u201cBased on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\u201d Trump\u2019s Feb. 19 post read. Here are Obama\u2019s comments during Cohen\u2019s speed-round interview , when the former president answered several questions in a short period of time. Cohen: \u201cSo I want to do a little bit of a lightning round here, because it\u2019s not often I\u2019ll get access to the president of the United States. So a couple questions here. Are aliens real?\u201d Obama: \u201cThey\u2019re real, but I haven\u2019t seen them, and they\u2019re not being kept in, what is it?\u201d Cohen: \u201cArea 51?\u201d Obama: \u201cArea 51. There\u2019s no underground facility, unless there\u2019s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.\u201d Declassified documents released in 2013 during Obama\u2019s presidency acknowledged the existence of Area 51, saying that the secret government space was used as an aerial testing ground for U.S. government projects. Obama clarified his podcast remarks on social media , saying, \u201cI was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it\u2019s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there\u2019s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we\u2019ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\u201d While not discovered, there\u2019s a possibility that there could be life on other planets; NASA researchers said in August 2025 that they found a long-lasting source of chemical energy in the ancient past of planet Ceres that could have made it possible for microorganisms to survive. NASA noted that this doesn\u2019t mean that Ceres had life, but that there was likely \u201cfood\u201d available should life have ever arisen on Ceres. In 2024 the Pentagon\u2019s UFO office, called the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said it found \u201cno evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technologies.\u201d This fact check was originally published by PolitiFact , which is part of the Poynter Institute.

    "title": "Stephen Colbert\u2019s interview with James Talarico finds massive audience online",
    "content": "Commentary Newsletters Texas state Rep. James Talarico, D-Austin, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate speaks to the media earlier this week. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) By: Tom Jones February 20, 2026 Yeah, that interview that CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert did on Monday with Texas U.S. Senate candidate James Talarico that some people didn\u2019t want you to see? Well, apparently, a lot of people are seeing it. A lot. As you know by now, Colbert said CBS insisted the show did not air the interview with Talarico on his late-night show, claiming the network was worried about the FCC coming after it for the equal-time rule regarding political candidates. So the interview was shipped to the show\u2019s YouTube page while Colbert, the network and the FCC all pointed fingers publicly about what happened. But as far as the interview itself, it is being viewed by way more folks than would have seen it had no one made a fuss and it simply aired on Colbert\u2019s show as originally planned. According to Deadline\u2019s Dade Hayes , the interview \u201chas now drawn 85 million views across YouTube and social media.\u201d And that was as of Thursday morning. Hayes reported that the measuring firm Tubular Labs said over a 72-hour stretch, there were 1,320 video uploads featuring Colbert and Talarico across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. The videos have generated more than 8 million engagements, with the 85 million figure stemming from any viewing session lasting at least two seconds. Hayes wrote, \u201cThe most-watched individual clip, notably, is the full 15-minute interview. It has collected more than 7.5 million views, more than twice the daily average viewing level of Colbert\u2019s YouTube channel.\u201d Since Colbert revealed on Monday night what had happened with the Talarico interview, there have been statements and comments from all sides. Typically, the equal-time rule does not apply to late-night shows, but the FCC recently began looking into whether ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d violated the equal-time rule by also interviewing Talarico. That raised concerns that late-night shows could be next. CBS, according to Colbert, felt spooked enough to keep Colbert\u2019s interview with Talarico off TV So who\u2019s to blame? CBS or the FCC? The debate rages on. The FCC\u2019s sole Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, blamed both. She tweeted on Thursday, \u201cThe FCC is engaged in a campaign of censorship and control. They may not have ordered The Late Show interview pulled. But when government interferes in editorial decisions, broadcasters are forced to self-censor or push back. CBS chose not to push back.\u201d Speaking of CBS Puck\u2019s Dylan Byers reported that Anderson Cooper\u2019s decision to leave \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u201cblindsided\u201d CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss and the rest of leadership. They believed they were close to signing Cooper to a new contract. One source told Byers, \u201cThese negotiations were on the one-yard line.\u201d Another source told Byers, \u201cIt was total chaos. Everyone was caught off guard.\u201d Cooper, who remains on at CNN, said in a statement that he wanted to spend more time with his family. But there have been reports that he was wary of a rightward direction at CBS News. Byers wrote that, while he didn\u2019t know what was inside Cooper\u2019s head, his decision was likely less out of protest against the network \u201cthan a personal rejection of the entire Trump II\u2013era CBS psychodrama, which, frankly, isn\u2019t worth his time.\u201d Journalism controversy of the week A week ago, The Atlantic published a story from Elizabeth Bruenig: \u201cThis Is How a Child Dies of Measles.\u201d As Laura Hazard Owen explained in her piece for Nieman Lab , \u201cIt\u2019s written in the second person, from the point of view of a woman whose two unvaccinated children get measles \u2014 with ultimately horrific long-term consequences for her son.\u201d The essay\u2019s many details about the children and second-person storytelling led readers to believe that the story was a first-hand account. Owen herself wrote, \u201cWhen I initially read Bruenig\u2019s story, I was stunned: An Atlantic staff writer\u2019s unvaccinated child had died of measles in the 2020s, and now she was writing about it?\u201d That\u2019s how many readers took it. But then there was this unusual editor\u2019s note at the end of The Atlantic story: \u201cThis story is based on extensive reporting and interviews with physicians, including those who have cared directly for patients with measles.\u201d So, wait, this was not the author\u2019s personal experience? Owen reached out to Bruenig, who said, \u201cIt is a hypothetical account of a very real phenomenon based on careful reporting. I would place it somewhere on the creative nonfiction spectrum.\u201d Owen went on to ask Bruening many more detailed questions about her writing choice, as well as about the topic, which was measles. Then Owen updated her story on Thursday to write, \u201cAfter this piece was published, I heard from two different people who received The Atlantic\u2019s original press push email for the piece around 4:30 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. At that time, when they clicked through, there was not an editor\u2019s note/disclaimer on the piece at all. Both of those readers, who are professional journalists, responded to the press email with confusion and asked if the story was real. An Atlantic publicist emailed one of these readers back and said, \u2018This is based on a mother\u2019s real account. Thanks for checking.\u2019 Sometime after that, the disclaimer was added and it was there when I read the story around 7 p.m. on Thursday night. A spokesperson for The Atlantic told me yesterday, \u2018The note was added almost immediately after publication.\u2019 This information is significant to me because it suggests that within The Atlantic there was confusion about whether the piece was fictional.\u201d No doubt that Bruenig\u2019s story is powerful. But many readers got lost in the confusion. Bruening told Owen, \u201cI collaborated closely with my editors on this piece, and we were attracted to the idea of providing a play-by-play of the progression of measles in granular detail. It seemed like the best way to lay it all out was to spin a narrative that touches on every important aspect of a measles infection, from the biological processes inside the body, to the governmental response, to an outbreak. Writing in the second person made sense to me because it\u2019s a hypothetical addressed to parents weighing these decisions or facing outbreaks in their communities. I write nonfiction either in the first person or third, so this felt like a way to signal that this is a different kind of story. On the other hand, writing in the second person always feels a little bit goofy. We included an editor\u2019s note to remove any possibility of confusion. And yes, it does make sense to me to describe it as a story about ideas.\u201d Listeners upset Recently, authorities investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of \u201cToday\u201d show co-host Savannah Guthrie, released door camera footage of a man in a mask outside of the elder Guthrie\u2019s home around the time she disappeared. In discussing the story on NPR, \u201cMorning Edition\u201d host Steve Inskeep interviewed a former FBI profiler. During the interview, Inskeep said the man\u2019s mask made him look \u201ca little like a federal immigration agent.\u201d That comment was the focus of the latest NPR public editor\u2019s column by my colleague, Kelly McBride . According to McBride, \u201cListeners flooded our inbox with concerns about this correlation.\u201d McBride reports the comment was not in the script. Inskeep\u2019s full question was, \u201cSo let me think about this. We have this man. He walks up to the porch. His \u2014 he\u2019s armed and his face is covered, a little like a federal immigration agent, although it\u2019s more covered even than that. He\u2019s wearing gloves. His head\u2019s down. Other times, head up. Something in the mouth. Looks like a flashlight in the mouth. Walks up to the security camera. That\u2019s what I see. What do you see, and what do you read from that?\u201d McBride writes, \u201cComparing the intruder on Guthrie\u2019s porch to a federal immigration agent was both irrelevant and inflammatory. The short phrase was interpreted by listeners to be a commentary on the controversial tactics of federal law enforcement. Some news consumers who care deeply about the dramatic story of Guthrie\u2019s kidnapping felt like the comment was a sign of disrespect.\u201d McBride added, \u201cAn NPR news executive who would only talk on background told me that Inskeep did not intend for the statement to be political commentary. Instead, the off-the-cuff description was meant to help the audience understand what was in the video. It was not meant to connect the scrutiny of federal officers to the intruder on Guthrie\u2019s porch, the news executive said.\u201d Check out the column for more of McBride\u2019s thoughts on this matter. Worth watching \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper\u201d returns Sunday night at 8 p.m. Eastern on CNN with a piece by CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown: \u201cThe Rise of Christian Nationalism.\u201d As CNN explains it, Brown will look at the \u201cideology rooted in the belief that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and that its laws and institutions should reflect Christian values.\u201d In a statement, Brown said, \u201cMy reporting for this hour began early last year when I visited Moscow, Idaho to interview Pastor Douglas Wilson. The response to that report was overwhelming and highlighted the need to better understand this movement working to redefine America as a Christian nation in the home, in a marriage, in schools and in government. We embedded with a community under Pastor Wilson\u2019s umbrella and spoke to women who have left the church and are now sounding the alarm. No matter where you live or what you believe, what we learned is especially consequential at this moment.\u201d Speaking of Wilson, The Washington Post\u2019s Amy B Wang wrote, \u201cHegseth invited Christian nationalist Doug Wilson to preach at Pentagon.\u201d Media news, tidbits, and interesting links for your weekend review Deadline\u2019s Ted Johnson with \u201cSenate Democrats Ask David Ellison To \u201cPreserve Records\u201d As They Threaten Investigation Of Paramount Contacts With Trump Over WB Bid.\u201d Good column from Mediaite\u2019s Tommy Christopher: \u201cTrump and Karoline Leavitt Tried To Laugh Off \u2018False Accusations\u2019 Of Racism \u2014 Too Many In Media Played Along.\u201d The Los Angeles Times\u2019 Cerys Davies with \u201cCBS\u2019 Bari Weiss pulls out of UCLA lecture.\u201d My Poynter colleague, Amaris Castillo with \u201cWhen newspapers cut book coverage, communities lose more than reviews.\u201d For Esquire, John Hendrickson profiles the legendary magazine writer in \u201cTom Junod Finally Reckons with What It Means to Be a Man.\u201d Fun design and story here from The New York Times Magazine about a famous photo: \u201c\u2018I Had No Idea How to Handle That\u2019: The Drama Behind a Tense Ice Skating Moment.\u201d Correction: In Thursday\u2019s newsletter, I wrote about CBS News\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell sitting in next week on the network\u2019s morning show.

    "title": "Trump is reshaping how the federal government presents Black history",
    "content": "Fact-Checking A National Parks Service worker puts his hand on a panel that was part of an exhibit on slavery at the President's House Site in Philadelphia to be put back Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026. (AP Photo/Joe Lamberti) By: Louis Jacobson February 20, 2026 It\u2019s Black History Month \u2014 and President Donald Trump has put his stamp on the decades-old commemoration. The White House\u2019s 2026 Black History Month proclamation said Black history \u201cis not distinct from American history.\u201d Black History Month, the proclamation said, has been twisted by \u201cthe progressive movement and far-left politicians\u201d who have \u201csought to needlessly divide our citizens on the basis of race, painting a toxic and distorted and disfigured vision of our history, heritage, and heroes.\u201d At a Feb. 18 White House event , Trump lauded Black celebrities and closed his remarks with, \u201cHappy Black History Month! Happy Black History Year! And happy Black History Century!\u201d Since starting his second term, Trump has sought to reshape the government\u2019s portrayal of Black history. Trump has issued executive orders curtailing the government\u2019s use of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Since then, federal agencies have taken a number of high-profile steps to remove historical information portrayed through the lens of race. Some have subsequently been reversed, modified or blocked in court. It remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s executive orders and the removals could have a chilling effect on museums, historical sites and federal agencies going forward. \u201cNo other presidential administration has interfered with these (historical) sites in this way before,\u201d said Leslie M. Harris, a Northwestern University historian and author of five books on slavery in the U.S. \u201cA short-term outcome could be a distrust, even an avoidance, of government sites.\u201d In response to our request for comment, White House spokesperson Olivia Wales outlined what she said are Trump\u2019s accomplishments for Black Americans spanning both his presidencies, including criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, long-term funding of historically black colleges, school choice funding, Trump Accounts and \u201cthe largest middle-class tax cuts in history.\u201d What did Trump\u2019s executive orders say? Within hours of his Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration, Trump issued an executive order mandating the termination of what it called \u201call discriminatory programs\u201d including DEI \u201cmandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities\u201d in the federal government. A second March 27, 2025, executive order , titled \u201cRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History,\u201d sought to counter what it characterized as \u201ca concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation\u2019s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\u201d The executive order specifically addressed the Smithsonian Institution and said people visiting museums should not \u201cbe subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.\u201d (In August 2025, PolitiFact visited several Smithsonian museums and rated Trump\u2019s statement that the Smithsonian includes \u201cnothing about success, nothing about brightness, nothing about the future\u201d Pants on Fire . ) The order also directed the interior secretary \u2014 whose department includes the National Park Service that operates hundreds of historical sites and interpretive exhibits \u2014 to reinstate materials that had been \u201cremoved or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d How have these orders been implemented? Here are some examples of ways the executive orders have been implemented that are still in place: The \u201cscarred back\u201d photograph . An 1863 image of a man who escaped slavery and bore deep scars on his back from being whipped was removed from display at the Fort Pulaski National Monument near Savannah, Georgia, Greenwire reported in September 2025. The 1863 photo is well known because of its use by abolitionists and inclusion in modern textbooks. Statue of Confederate general Albert Pike . Protesters tore down and burned the Washington, D.C., statue during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, but the National Park Service renovated and reinstalled it in October 2025. National Park Service gift shops . The Interior Department issued a November 2025 memo ordering its gift shops to remove any items promoting DEI or gender expression, The New York Times reported . Louisiana landmark designation . Following a multi-year National Park Service review, the Great River Road, an 11-mile corridor in Louisiana with a deep history of slavery, was pulled from consideration for National Historic Landmark designation. Black Lives Matter plaza . Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser removed a mural of the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d near the White House, painted on the street after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The removal followed the introduction of legislation by Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., to withhold federal funds from the city didn\u2019t remove it. Other actions were modified or reversed after public backlash, including: Harriet Tubman web page . The National Park Service initially removed a large photo and quotations from Tubman, an anti-slavery advocate, from a web page about the Underground Railroad, but it was later restored . Pentagon web pages . Weeks after Trump returned to office, the Pentagon marked tens of thousands of web pages for deletion based on the DEI executive order\u2019s standards. But after an outcry about the removal of a page about Jackie Robinson, the first Black major league baseball player, Robinson\u2019s page was restored . It\u2019s unclear whether other pages were restored and how many that were marked for deletion were formally deleted. Plantation grants . Two federal grants to the Whitney Plantation in Louisiana, which offers tours and exhibits about the realities of life under slavery, were initially rescinded, but later restored , The New York Times reported. In at least one case, the courts have blocked an administration action \u2014 the removal of biographical panels about nine people enslaved by the nation\u2019s first president, George Washington, when Philadelphia was the nation\u2019s capital. On Feb. 16, a federal judge ruled that the panels had to be returned; the federal government is appealing. In a statement to PolitiFact, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said the Interior Department \u201cis engaged in an ongoing review of our nation\u2019s American history exhibits in accordance with the president\u2019s executive order to eliminate corrosive ideology, restore sanity, and reinstate the truth.\u201d Rogers said the department\u2019s actions are not finalized and she called the lawsuits \u201cpremature.\u201d On Feb. 17, advocacy groups announced another lawsuit against the Trump administration, targeting the removal of civil rights information, as well as climate change and other subjects, at national parks. What is the impact? Historians said the administration\u2019s moves are misguided. \u201cThe removal of this complex history from National Park Service sites is concerning, as these places are an important source of historical information for the general public,\u201d said Harris, the Northwestern University historian. For example, the removal of the historical panels about people enslaved by George Washington \u201cerases heroic and inspirational American stories of courage and patriotism\u201d by enslaved people, said James Madison University historian Steven A. Reich. The removal of exhibits or historical information also endangers freedom of thought, a cornerstone of democracy, Reich said. \u201cHow to tell the story of the country\u2019s past, in a democratic society, is as open and fluid as the debate over any matter of public policy,\u201d he said. For Trump, who has touted his improved performance among Black voters in the 2024 election, the executive orders he\u2019s signed make it \u201chard to argue that he wants to help Black people,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an Emory University political scientist.

    "title": "CBS keeps finding new ways to have a bad week",
    "content": "Commentary Newsletters CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert, shown here at the Emmy Awards last September. (Jordan Strauss/Invision for the Television Academy/AP Content Services) By: Tom Jones February 19, 2026 This is The Poynter Report, your daily guide to the news about news. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every weekday. It has been another awkward and miserable week at CBS. The network has been in the news a lot. And not in a positive way. First, CBS News lost one of the most respected journalists in the business when Anderson Cooper announced he was stepping away from the venerable \u201c60 Minutes\u201d after nearly two decades. It\u2019s true that Cooper has a ton of other jobs to keep him busy, most notably hosting a weeknight show on CNN. And, in his statement about leaving the news magazine show, Cooper said he wanted to spend more time with his family. (Don\u2019t people always say that?) But Status\u2019 Oliver Darcy also reported that \u201cCooper had grown increasingly uneasy with the rightward direction the network has charted under\u201d CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss and David Ellison\u2019s ownership of CBS\u2019 parent company, Paramount. Whatever the reason, Cooper\u2019s departure \u2014 and the rumored unrest among others on the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d staff \u2014 has the program itself and the news division as a whole in a state of uncertainty. Then came the whole Stephen Colbert drama. By now, you know the late-night host wanted to have Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico on the show, but claims he was told \u201cin no uncertain terms by our network\u2019s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast.\u201d The network, according to Colbert, was worried about the Federal Communications Commission rule about equal time, which means if a station gives airtime to one candidate, then that station must offer an equal amount of time to other candidates in that contest, should they ask for it. Late-night shows typically don\u2019t fall under the \u201cequal-time\u201d rules. However, FCC commissioner Brendan Carr has questioned the talk-show exemption and even launched an investigation into ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d regarding the equal time rule after Talarico appeared on that show. All of that, apparently, was enough to spook CBS into, according to Colbert, telling him he couldn\u2019t have Talarico on his show. ( The interview ended up on the show\u2019s YouTube channel, where it has way more views \u2014 more than 6.3 million as of Wednesday \u2014 than it would have gotten on the actual CBS show.) The network and Colbert have gone back and forth over the details of what happened. It sort of came to a close Tuesday night when Colbert, on his show, said he wasn\u2019t \u201cmad\u201d at CBS and doesn\u2019t want an \u201cadversarial relationship with the network.\u201d He then said he had no idea what to do with the CBS statement, which he held on a piece of paper in his hand. Then he jokingly picked it up with a bag and wrapped it up, as if it were dog poop. In the end, it was another messy situation in which CBS came out looking much worse than anyone else in this melodrama. As Salon\u2019s Sophia Tesfaye wrote , \u201cIn the span of months, one of America\u2019s most storied broadcast institutions has managed to alienate its most recognizable late-night host and lose one of its most respected journalists, all while inviting scrutiny over whether it is voluntarily bending the knee to political pressure from the Trump administration. The optics are catastrophic.\u201d Tesfaye added, \u201cWhat we are watching is the systematic dismantling of institutional independence in real time at one of the most historically significant news and entertainment corporations in America. Stephen Colbert is leaving in May. Anderson Cooper is already gone. What CBS should be asking itself is not how to manage the departure of the people who made it matter, but whether anyone left in the building still believes the mission is worth defending.\u201d Smart point In talking about this whole FCC equal-time-late-night business, CNN media reporter and analyst Brian Stelter reminded viewers of a very smart point recently made by Don Lemon, the independent journalist recently arrested on charges that he violated federal law during a recent protest at a church in Minnesota. Lemon will likely win his case, and the late shows probably don\u2019t need to worry about the FCC\u2019s regulations on equal time, at least for now. But the point isn\u2019t how it will all end. Stelter, quoting Lemon, said , \u201cThe process is the punishment.\u201d In other words, all this hassle that Lemon has to go through \u2014 being charged, appearing in court, mounting a defense, and so on \u2014 is the part that drains someone and makes their life difficult. Same with, say, Colbert having to spend time dealing with all the fallout from having a guest interview nixed and living under a constant threat from the Trump administration, while also wondering if the network that canceled him is going to have his back. As Lemon said, and as Stelter reiterated: The process is the punishment. Which is why you see some places and people just give in to Trump and, for instance, settle lawsuits they would\u2019ve likely won instead of fighting. Or, in the case of CBS and Colbert, the network, according to Colbert, didn\u2019t air the interview to avoid a potential fight with the FCC. For many, the fight just isn\u2019t worth it, and Trump seems to know that. What was that? There was an interesting moment during White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s briefing with the media on Wednesday. Leavitt was asked a question about something President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. Trump essentially said British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was making a \u201cbig mistake\u201d by entering into a lease of the U.S.-UK air base on Diego Garcia. (In a 2025 deal, Britain agreed to transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius but lease Diego Garcia back for 99 years so the base can continue operating.) A reporter asked specifically about Trump\u2019s Truth Social post and what it meant in terms of America\u2019s policy. Leavitt said, \u201cThe post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration. It\u2019s coming straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. When you see it on Truth Social, you know it\u2019s directly from President Trump. That\u2019s the beauty of this president, and his transparency in relaying this administration\u2019s policies to all of you and to the rest of the world.\u201d To repeat, Leavitt said, \u201cWhen you see it on Truth Social, you know it\u2019s directly from President Trump.\u201d Yet, wasn\u2019t it just a week ago when Trump denied knowing anything about a Truth Social post under his name that depicted former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, as apes? At the time, White House officials blamed the video on a staffer, and Trump said he \u201cdidn\u2019t see the whole thing.\u201d He also refused to apologize, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d But now Leavitt is claiming that if you see it on Truth Social, it came from Trump. O\u2019Donnell back to mornings? CBS News\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell, shown here in 2019. (Jason Mendez/Invision/AP) The New York Post\u2019s Alexandra Steigrad reports that Norah O\u2019Donnell will fill in as co-host on \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d for a few days next week. It will be something of a homecoming for O\u2019Donnell, who was a co-host on the morning program \u2014 then called \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d \u2014 from 2012 to 2019. She left to become anchor of the \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d a post she held until stepping away in 2025. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s return next week is sparking rumors about coming back to the morning show full-time. Tony Dokoupil recently left as co-host of \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d to become anchor of the \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d Dokoupil was co-hosting with Gayle King and Nate Burleson. Steigrad wrote, \u201cIt is unclear if the move is a test to see if there\u2019s any chemistry between King, O\u2019Donnell, and co-host Nate Burleson, as top brass is looking to overhaul the struggling, last-place program.\u201d However, Steigrad added, \u201cA source close to CBS threw cold water on that idea, saying that O\u2019Donnell is not being considered for the role and is instead part of a rotating cast of people to help fill in the gaps until a third co-host is named.\u201d O\u2019Donnell will be in New York as part of a book tour. She continues to work at CBS News as a senior correspondent. Thinking of their colleague Speaking of morning shows, the NBC \u201cToday\u201d show set was decorated with yellow ribbons and flowers in support of co-host Savannah Guthrie, who continues to be away from the program to attend to matters involving the disappearance of her 84-year-old mother, Nancy. The ribbons and flowers on the \u201cToday\u201d set were similar to the ones outside of Nancy Guthrie\u2019s home in Arizona. She has been missing since Feb. 1. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said this week that his department is chasing thousands of tips and leads. He told NBC News , \u201cAs long as we have the ability to chase a lead, it\u2019s not cold. We\u2019re not going to give up. We\u2019re going to find Nancy, and we\u2019re going to find out who did this.\u201d One more In this newsletter on Tuesday, I wrote about the passing of actor Robert Duvall and how he was in two movies that centered around journalism: 1976\u2019s \u201cNetwork\u201d and 1994\u2019s \u201cThe Paper.\u201d Then in Wednesday\u2019s newsletter, I wrote about how I forgot that he played a journalist in another movie \u2014 the 1984 classic, \u201cThe Natural,\u201d where he played a sportswriter.

    "title": "When newspapers cut book coverage, communities lose more than reviews",
    "content": "Business & Work Ethics & Trust (Simple Line/Shutterstock) By: Amaris Castillo February 19, 2026 Laurie Hertzel remembers the old building on Portland Avenue in downtown Minneapolis and the space it had carved out just for books. At the time, she was the Minneapolis Star Tribune\u2019s books editor, a fitting role for the daughter of a librarian and an English professor. The book room was in the basement, deep in the bowels of the building. Hertzel wheeled an old grocery shopping cart onto the elevator and down to where the printing presses once stood. Nobody, she remembers, went down there. Except maybe the mice. But there was the book room. \u201cIt had a locked door and you\u2019d walk in and turn the light on, and it was just this wonderful space because it had shelves all the way around and it had this long table for sorting books,\u201d Hertzel said. \u201cIt had no windows, but you could shut the door and you could just be down there, and it was like a clean, well-lighted space.\u201d Each month, Hertzel received about 1,000 books in the mail from publishers and authors eager for coverage. Piles of advance reader copies and books filled the room. At the time, the Star Tribune devoted two open Sunday pages for book reviews and literary news. Hertzel later expanded coverage by penning and commissioning reviews on Tuesdays, the industry\u2019s standard release day for new books. She would load the cart with books and head back up to the third-floor newsroom. The U.S. publishing industry is massive, generating about $30 billion of annual revenue, according to the Association of American Publishers . But despite all that money, newspaper book coverage is disappearing. The Associated Press ceased its weekly book reviews last year, and The Washington Post ended its book section earlier this month amid mass layoffs. \u201cI don\u2019t know why newspapers have done it, and they\u2019ve done it across the board almost,\u201d said Colette Bancroft, former books editor for the Tampa Bay Times, who has witnessed this hollowing out for more than a decade. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why. I have never understood it.\u201d There are a number of culprits: Staff reductions, shrinking newspaper budgets, reader habits that are rapidly shifting towards the digital realm. When a community loses book coverage, it creates a ripple effect. Writers lose visibility, stunting their reach. Readers lose out on books and ideas they may not come across if they\u2019re not already plugged into Bookstagram or BookTok. Local arts lose support. Freelancers and critics lose income. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last decade is diminishing coverage for books across the entire country, and it is really devastating for writers,\u201d said award-winning author Cleyvis Natera. \u201cBecause for many of us, we\u2019ve been working on our books for years, and it is still very difficult to have a direct path to connect with readers outside of our local environment and outside of our own personal networks.\u201d Both of Natera\u2019s books \u2014 \u201cNeruda on the Park\u201d and \u201cThe Grand Paloma Resort\u201d \u2014 received reviews in The New York Times, which she described as very meaningful. Her debut also received some coverage from local outlets in New Jersey, where she lives, but it was minimal. Her latest book received even less local attention. \u201cI had my publicist reach out and, unfortunately, a lot of the newspapers are no longer running book reviews or (have) limited resources.\u201d Before Kali Fajardo-Anstine \u2019s widely acclaimed short story collection \u201cSabrina & Corina\u201d was published in 2019, she spent years as an independent bookseller in Colorado. The National Book Award finalist recalls how someone would always bring in The New York Times Book Review, the weekly Sunday supplement dedicated to books. \u201cAnd we would look, what should we be ordering, what books are getting coverage,\u201d she said. Fajardo-Anstine has since published \u201cWoman of Light,\u201d an award-winning novel about a tea leaf reader and laundress who fights to save her family\u2019s stories in 1930s Denver. But neither of her books received a standalone review in major U.S. newspapers like The New York Times. The Boston Globe did review \u201cWoman of Light.\u201d So did The Guardian . Locally, The Denver Post did a feature on the author. For the award-winning Fajardo-Anstine, navigating the lack of traditional newspaper coverage has been confusing. Smaller papers in Denver and word-of-mouth have helped her work gain traction. She remains hopeful about future books. Allison K Hill, chief executive officer of the American Booksellers Association , said independent bookstores can relate to the challenges newspapers face. But, she noted, cutting book coverage is a missed opportunity to reimagine it rather than retreat from it. \u201cOn a Venn diagram, the circles of book readers and newspaper readers overlap significantly; book coverage is an opportunity for newspapers to lean in, not out,\u201d Hill told Poynter in an email. There are now fewer staff book critics at newspapers, which Adam Dalva says is a shame. He is the president of the National Book Critics Circle , an organization of more than 800 members that supports book criticism. \u201cI love when critics have this kind of perch where they can say, \u2018I\u2019m going to build a corpus, or a body of thought, around books, instead of exclusively using freelancers,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so few full-time book critics left in America.\u201d Dalva, himself an author, said newspapers and magazines now more often commission reviews from other authors. But he wants people to remember the cultural importance of books. \u201cIn the long run, what we\u2019re doing when we run book reviews is building a network of thought that can carry forward for many years. And we find that books offer the kind of slow thinking and careful deliberation that reflect on society and feed into every form of culture and politics and life,\u201d Dalva said. \u201cI think a book section, if it\u2019s robust and vibrant, is able to provide commentary on everything that\u2019s happening, say, in America or in the world.\u201d In 2024, Colette Bancroft took a buyout , leaving her role as books editor at the Pulitzer Prize-winning Tampa Bay Times after 17 years. For roughly the first half of her tenure, she had a budget to pay freelancers. Then it disappeared. Bancroft recalled the common sentiment that book coverage doesn\u2019t get enough readers. \u201cI know they swear by the clicks, and those clicks are real, but I don\u2019t know, to me it\u2019s part of serving your community to cover arts in your community,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it makes it much harder for local arts organizations to survive if they don\u2019t have support from news organizations in their community.\u201d Bancroft, who has since returned to Arizona, continues to write for Bay Magazine, the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 luxury lifestyle magazine. She knows she\u2019s not the only books editor whose role disappeared and wasn\u2019t replaced. It\u2019s part of a broader trend she still struggles to understand. News outlets need readers, and people who love to read, she said, tend to read both books and newspapers. \u201cAnd if you dump newspaper coverage, you\u2019re kind of shooting yourself in the foot.\u201d Back in Minnesota, Laurie Hertzel retired from the Star Tribune in 2023. She now teaches in the low-residency MFA in narrative nonfiction program at the University of Georgia in Athens and also reviews books as a freelancer for The Boston Globe and, until recently, The Washington Post. Book coverage, once a core part of newspaper criticism, has undeniably diminished. \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad, because newspapers traditionally have been kind of a generalist outlet. \u2026 It\u2019s supposed to be an array of things that are important to the community that the newspaper covers.\u201d Hertzel said those decisions are made by higher-ups, a role she never held. \u201cBut it seems very shortsighted to me, to start cutting things that people do read. And does everybody read book coverage? No. But I will tell you, the ones who do are fervent about it.\u201d Poynter is a nonprofit dedicated to keeping journalism strong, relevant, and grounded in sound values.

    "title": "Viral posts falsely name Savannah Guthrie\u2019s husband as a \u2018co-conspirator\u2019 in the Epstein files",
    "content": "Fact-Checking Michael Feldman, left, and Savannah Guthrie attend the third annual World Mental Health Day Gala, hosted by Project Healthy Minds, at Spring Studios on Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) By: Maria Brice\u00f1o February 19, 2026 After Nancy Guthrie\u2019s Feb.1 abduction from her Tucson, Arizona, home, her daughter \u201cToday\u201d host Savannah Guthrie put out a call on social media for tips on her mother\u2019s whereabouts, pleading for her safe return. So far, social media users have been less than helpful. With the Justice Department\u2019s Jan. 30 release of more than 3 million pages of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, X users proposed bogus links between the abduction and the file release. Multiple X posts include a photo of Savannah Guthrie\u2019s family and an accusation about her husband, Michael Feldman. \u201cHer husband\u2019s company is listed as a co conspirator in the Epstein files\u2026 FGS Global,\u201d reads a Feb. 12 X post with over 1 million views. \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering why now of all times for Savannah Guthrie\u2019s mother to be \u2018kidnapped.'\u201d The co-anchor\u2019s husband isn\u2019t named in the Epstein files, and neither is his current company. Searching the digital Epstein files , we found one 2013 email to Epstein from a person named Michael Feldman, but it seems to be someone else, introducing himself as a \u201ctheoretical physicist.\u201d Guthrie\u2019s husband is a communications consultant who previously worked in the Clinton administration as chief liaison to Congress and senior adviser for former Vice President Al Gore. Feldman currently works as North American co-chairman of FGS Global, an international public relations firm. We did not find FGS Global listed in Justice Department files, but another public affairs company that was merged to found FGS Global was listed. As a community note on one of the X posts said, Feldman helped found Glover Park Group in 2001, and its name appears twice in the Epstein files. The firm merged with other companies to form FGS Global in 2021. PolitiFact reached out to FGS Global, but didn\u2019t receive an immediate response. The first mention was in 2014. The office of Terje R\u00f8d-Larsen, a former diplomat and former president of the International Peace Institute , shared a list of articles with Epstein, and one story mentioned the Glover Park Group\u2019s work lobbying for Egyptian interests. The second was in a 2015 email forwarded by Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury secretary and former Harvard University president. Summers suggested that Epstein contact Joe Lockhart, who worked at the Glover Park Group and served as press secretary during the Clinton administration, as well as other Democratic politicians. The initial email says Lockhart \u201chelped Clinton and Genera= (sic) Petraeus.\u201d (Former CIA director and retired U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus had an extramarital affair uncovered in 2012.) Screenshot of a Jan. 8, 2015, email exchange in the Epstein files These mentions are not evidence that Feldman, FGS Global or Glover Park Group were \u201cco-conspirators\u201d with Epstein. Being mentioned in the files does not mean criminal wrongdoing. We reported in 2025 that figures such as President Donald Trump and Clinton appear in the files, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are guilty or charged with crimes. As of February 2026, Epstein and his coconspirator Ghislaine Maxwell are the only people who have been convicted in the scheme to sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Feb. 16 on X that the Guthrie family, including \u201call siblings and spouses,\u201d had been cleared as possible suspects in the Nancy Guthrie case. We rate the X posts\u2019 claims about Guthrie\u2019s husband\u2019s company False. This fact check was originally published by PolitiFact , which is part of the Poynter Institute.

    "title": "What Ash Wednesday can teach journalists about truth and humility",
    "content": "Commentary Ethics & Trust Father Fabian Arias places an ash cross on the forehead of a devotee during Ash Wednesday outside the Jacob K. Javits federal building, Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) By: Fernanda Camarena February 18, 2026 Ash Wednesday begins with a fact. \u201cRemember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\u201d Growing up, hearing that phrase in church felt heavy in a way I didn\u2019t yet understand. Today, as a faithful Catholic and journalist, it feels simple, clarifying and honest. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, a season marked by repentance, fasting, reflection and, on Easter Sunday, a celebration of Jesus\u2019 resurrection. In church, a priest traces a small cross of ashes on your forehead and repeats that same reminder about dust. It\u2019s an invitation to reflect and remember that none of us is bigger than the truth and God. It\u2019s a time to remember that what we do matters, and that our time is limited. It emphasizes confronting our limits, biases and failures. That idea should resonate with journalists. The Society of Professional Journalists\u2019 Code of Ethics begins with a clear guideline: Seek truth and report it . It calls journalists to strive for accuracy, fairness, transparency and accountability. So when Pope Leo XIV released his message for Lent this year , it hit home. He called for three things: deeper listening, fasting from harmful language and stronger relationships with one another. It wasn\u2019t abstract. It offered practical guidance and a solid framework that speaks directly to the ethical demands of journalism today. Here are some highlights from the three parts of his message. Listening: \u2018Enter into relationship\u2019 Pope Leo XIV wrote, \u201cThe willingness to listen is the first way we demonstrate our desire to enter into relationship with someone.\u201d He added: \u201cGod himself teaches us that listening is one of his defining characteristics.\u201c When I read those lines, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about our duties as journalists \u2014 what reporters, managers and entire newsrooms do when we\u2019re at our best. I teach active listening in Poynter leadership programs. It\u2019s a foundational newsroom pillar. Trust is not built in the moment we hit publish or share on social media. It\u2019s built in the moments when we slow down and listen to the communities we aim to serve \u2014 their fears, frustrations and grief. Listening is a skill we can develop and learn. Done right, it protects us from projecting our assumptions and helps us look through a lens of empathy. Moana Ram\u00edrez, vice president of newsgathering at Univision Network, spends a lot of time thinking about how to keep her audience\u2019s trust. I met her while leading a training session with her former team in San Antonio and she soon became a friend who I enjoy chatting with about journalism issues. \u201cWith all the newsroom noise, it\u2019s a unique challenge to distinguish between the actual story and what really matters,\u201d she said in an email. She also shared one example. \u201cWe recently did a story about a woman who was being evicted from her home with her 11-year-old twin girls, her 10-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter after her eldest son was recently detained and waiting for deportation. As we helped the woman not be evicted that cold Tuesday night in January, we found ourselves being the link between community resources and the community that believes in our mission as journalists to help them.\u201d Journalism is a public service, and sometimes that means making difficult choices. \u201cDuring the development of the story, we made a hard stop when we realized that we would be harming the mother more than helping her by airing her story,\u201d Moana wrote. \u201cWe feared that she would be identified and deported. We did the behind-the-scenes work because we felt the need.\u201d It wasn\u2019t easy, but the newsroom made its journalistic mission and values a priority. \u201cThis story and the decision to make the hard stop was part of our collective listening,\u201d she said, \u201cand it matters because its what keeps us human as journalists in a difficult time to cover stories like these.\u201d Moana, who serves on Poynter\u2019s National Advisory Board and is a practicing Catholic, said the responsibility of leading a newsroom that serves the migrant community is one she doesn\u2019t take for granted. Fasting: \u2018Disarming our language\u2019 Pope Leo, in his Lenten message, said: \u201cIf Lent is a time for listening, fasting is a concrete way to prepare ourselves to receive the word of God.\u201d For Christians, fasting \u2014 going without food for a set period of time \u2014 is meant to help us grow. But Pope Leo expanded the traditional definition, suggesting that besides giving up food, we should remove harmful language from our lives. He wrote: \u201cI would like to invite you to a very practical and frequently unappreciated form of abstinence: that of refraining from words that offend and hurt our neighbor. Let us begin by disarming our language, avoiding harsh words and rash judgment, refraining from slander and speaking ill of those who are not present and cannot defend themselves.\u201d Quite a message, given that the temperature in our society, social media feeds and daily lives seems to increase with each passing week. The Pope continued: \u201cLet us strive to measure our words and cultivate kindness and respect in our families, among our friends, at work, on social media, in political debates, in the media and in Christian communities. In this way, words of hatred will give way to words of hope and peace.\u201d Together: \u2018Building a civilization of love\u2019 Pope Leo\u2019s words remind us that our Lenten journey isn\u2019t just personal, but something experienced as a community. For journalists, that means our work is more than reporting facts. It\u2019s about the way we listen to the needs of our audiences, the words we choose and the choices we make in answering one of the most fundamental questions: What is our journalistic mission and purpose? Moana shared an example that speaks directly to this. \u201cWe have been covering the immigration topic for years, and most recently seen firsthand all the detentions that are being done in Central Texas,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had an in-depth conversation in our morning editorial when our EP (executive producer) was brave enough to ask, \u2018 Con que fin estamos cubriendo estas historias \u2019 (\u2018What is our intention when covering these stories\u2019) that seem to be repetitive and seem to have no solution?\u201d The newsroom paused. Her story continued. \u201cThis made us reflect and critically think about our responsibility to be the voice for the immigrants inside the detention centers, as well as be the link to their stories with the politicians that can actually make a change.\u201d Right then and there, Moana\u2019s team established a mission statement for covering the migrant community. \u201cThese immigrants have told us firsthand that they watch Televisa Univision on a daily basis and they are grateful of the countless stories we have been telling all with heart and dignity to their immigration status,\u201d she added. Pope Leo\u2019s message concludes: \u201cLet us strive to make our communities places where the cry of those who suffer finds welcome, and listening opens paths towards liberation, making us ready and eager to contribute to building a civilization of love.\u201d A beautiful message, emphasizing that it\u2019s not about us as individuals, but our service for others, done with humility. I hope you all have a reflective and meaningful Lenten season. Poynter is a nonprofit dedicated to keeping journalism strong, relevant, and grounded in sound values.
