There are no state-funded or federally funded line items for protest payments, activist stipends, demonstration organizing, or political advocacy activities.

The non-profit has held press events opposing immigration roundups but denies funding or participating in the protests. Cabrera added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>CHIRLA is committed to advocacy grounded in democratic values. We promote peaceful engagement and civic participation.

On the morning of February 10, 2026, $4 million was wired directly to the Court of Justice as the full filing fee and initial bond for a sweeping civil lawsuit. The defendants named in the complaint: Pam Bondi and 28 other influential individuals--politicians, financiers, legal professionals, and high-profile figures whose names have repeatedly surfaced in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's network, flight logs, redacted documents, and Giuffre's own memoir Nobody's Girl.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is what the image attached to the post looked like at the time of writing:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0GKpJgVWEPYu1jR8s6duseBJhrcZwCwkVaqmPTXgcL96YuTbKCknwadRd5pwfp8Wel&amp;id=61553596763247\">  <source /> <img alt=\"Giuffre.png\" class=\"mt-image-none\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://leadstories.com/Giuffre.png\" width=\"514\" />  </a></p>\n<p><i>(Image source: Lead Stories screenshot of Facebook screenshot taken on Fri Feb 20 00:55:50 2026 UTC)</i></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/people/Lovely-Smiled-Baby/61553596763247/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Lovely Smiled Baby\" page</a> (archived <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260219180626/https://www.facebook.com/people/Lovely-Smiled-Baby/61553596763247/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) that published the claim was managed from the U.S.:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leadstories.com/ef2a3f784683bba1d5ce332b0de02f8d3e912bbf.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-19 at 1.08.45\u202fPM.png\" class=\"mt-image-none\" height=\"771\" src=\"https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2026/02/ef2a3f784683bba1d5ce332b0de02f8d3e912bbf-thumb-900x771-3179100.png\" width=\"900\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Image source: Lead Stories screenshot from Facebook)</em></p>\n<p>The contact section of that page also listed a Brooklyn address, but that, however, was followed by two words in Vietnamese that meant, as translated by <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/translator\" target=\"_blank\">DeepL</a>, \"United States\":</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leadstories.com/eab281e03abee802c51f803e4161ee8127bc08ce.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-19 at 1.02.29\u202fPM.png\" class=\"mt-image-none\" height=\"797\" src=\"https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2026/02/eab281e03abee802c51f803e4161ee8127bc08ce-thumb-900x797-3179098.png\" width=\"900\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Image source: Lead Stories screenshot from Facebook)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leadstories.com/600abddaf6b4df0fc1200158238239a7497865b4.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-19 at 12.59.26\u202fPM.png\" class=\"mt-image-none\" height=\"163\" src=\"https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2026/02/600abddaf6b4df0fc1200158238239a7497865b4-thumb-900xauto-3179096.png\" width=\"900\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Image source: Lead Stories screenshot from DeepL)</em></p>\n<p>The earliest version of the claim found by Lead Stories was published on Facebook on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122119925673037060&amp;set=a.122093810799037060\" target=\"_blank\">January 30, 2026</a> (archived <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260219202803/https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122119925673037060&amp;set=a.122093810799037060\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) by a page named \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/people/Chaos-Daily-247/61581111803138/\" target=\"_blank\">Chaos-Daily-247</a>\" (archived <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260220013623/https://www.facebook.com/people/Chaos-Daily-247/61581111803138/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).

No, that's not true: The video is authentic, but was more than three years old at the time of the former Duke of York's arrest on suspicion of \"misconduct in office\". It shows the October 2022 procession carrying the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II to St. Giles' Cathedral.

His telling of the story serves as a caution when it comes to assuming motives behind actions captured on video. Here are some quotes from Thomson which appeared in the article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><span>As the King and the rest of the Royals approached where I was, all I could hear was this man shouting. I could not make out what he was saying, all I could hear was noise.</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>I was worried about what he was going to do. It may sound daft but I thought he was going to jump the fence and attack the King.</span></span></li>\n<li><span>There's a time and a place to be shouting -- and that wasn't it. It was a funeral procession for the Queen.</span></li>\n<li><span></span>I restrained him to get him back from the fence. I certainly did not assault him. I put my hands on his shoulders and I pulled him back. The weight difference probably meant that I pulled him a bit harder than what I meant to. The man ended up falling backwards and landing on the ground.</li>\n</ul>",
